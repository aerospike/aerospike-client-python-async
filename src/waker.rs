//! Single persistent waker thread for `call_soon_threadsafe` dispatch.
//!
//! Tokio workers must not call `Python::attach` per completion: each
//! `PyGILState_Release` runs `PyThreadState_Clear`, which mimalloc's
//! abandoned-segment collector picks up at ~9.66% process CPU under
//! sustained async load.  Pinning each Tokio worker's thread-state
//! (Branch D) hangs at `z=32` even with the uvloop FT gate active
//! (zero-byte stdout wedge; confirmed 2026-06-18) — the failure mode
//! is intrinsic to keeping many concurrent persistent thread-states
//! on Tokio workers, not a uvloop side effect.
//!
//! Instead: Tokio workers push pure-Rust wake tokens (`Arc<CompletionInner>`)
//! over an mpsc channel.  ONE persistent daemon thread, spawned via Python's
//! `threading.Thread` so CPython owns its thread-state lifecycle, consumes
//! tokens and issues `call_soon_threadsafe(drainer)` to the correct asyncio
//! loop.  Because exactly one extra thread is persistently attached (not
//! many Tokio workers), the failure condition Branch D hit does not apply.
//!
//! Per-batch semantics are unchanged: `CompletionInner::drain_scheduled`
//! still gates wake tokens to one per batch, and `drain()` still runs on the
//! loop thread.
