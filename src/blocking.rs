//! Shared infrastructure for the ``*_blocking`` PyO3 method surface.
//!
//! Every blocking entry point goes through :func:`run_blocking`, which:
//!
//! 1. Rejects calls made from inside a running asyncio event loop (the
//!    user should use the async variant + ``await`` instead).
//! 2. Releases the GIL and drives the supplied future on the global
//!    Tokio runtime, returning when it completes.
//!
//! Moving these helpers into their own module keeps them reachable from
//! both ``lib.rs`` (client / op blocking methods) and ``tasks.rs`` (task
//! blocking methods) without bumping their visibility past ``pub(crate)``.
