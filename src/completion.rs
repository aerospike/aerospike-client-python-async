//! Per-`Client` batched completion bridge for async Python futures.
//!
//! Each `Client` owns one bridge → one queue → one drainer, all paired to the
//! event loop that created the client.  Under a multi-loop pool that means
//! completions never cross loops: loop A's completions enqueue into client-A's
//! bridge and wake client-A's drainer via `call_soon_threadsafe`.
//!
//! Inside one bridge, completions still batch — 32-way concurrency collapses
//! 32 GIL acquisitions per completion burst into 1.
//!
//! The bridge captures its owning event loop at construction and asserts it on
//! every call.  Sharing one `Client` across two event loops fails loud at the
//! first cross-loop call instead of silently routing a future from loop B
//! through loop A's drainer — a violation that is masked by the GIL but real
//! under free-threading.
